Set of simple scripts to build and install homebrewed PHP 
with or without dependencies on a debian/ubuntu system

setup:
- rename '_config.sh' to 'config.sh' and adjust your changes 
- rename '_build.sh'  to 'build.sh' and adjust your changes 


usage:

- config.sh 			: sets up variables for the script and is included in every of the other scripts
- install-dependencies.sh 	: tries to install all php dependencies via debian/ubuntu packages (including apache2/mysql)
- download.sh			: downloads and unpacks php source
- build.sh 			: configures and builds php from the source (assumes install-dependencies.sh and download.sh to be run before) 
- install.sh			: installs php in the system and tries to configure apache correctly
- install-all.sh		: runs whole installation process by calling all the other scripts
